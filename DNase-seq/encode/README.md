# ENCODE Uniform Processing Pipeline for DNaseHS experiments (dnase-seq-pipeline)

## Version
dnase_pipeline-2.1.2

This folder contains the dnanexus applets used in the ENCODE dnase-seq-pipeline. Most applets run 
bash scripts with straight-forward command-lines for third party tools.  The command-lines can readily 
be repurposed for a non-dnanexus environment.

## Applets (aka steps):
*Preparation:* Typically this step is only run once per reference genome (e.g. GCRh37/hg19).  
               The result of the preparation step is used in all subsequent pipeline runs for the same genome.
- dnase-index-bwa - Takes a genome reference gzipped fasta file (e.g. GCRh37/hg19), a DNase mappability file (optional) 
                    specific to a read size, a genome blacklist file (optional) and produces a bwa index in the form of 
                    a gzipped tar file, and a mappability gzipped tar file.
*Normal pipline:* The normal pipeline is actually 2 separate pipelines, as paired-end and single end fastqs are handled
                differently.  The '-pe' and '-se' alignment steps encapsulate the differences. 
- dnase-align-bwe-pe  - Takes two (paired-end) gzipped fastq file sets and a bwa built index of a reference genome 
                        (e.g. GCRh37/hg19) in the form of a gzipped tar archive.  This step aligns with bwa and returns 
                        a single bam file containing all reads mapped or otherwise and a QC metrics file.  
                        Used in ENCODE to align technical replicates.
- dnase-align-bwe-se  - Takes one (single-end) gzipped fastq file set and a bwa built index of a reference genome 
                        (e.g. GCRh37/hg19 female) in the form of a gzipped tar archive.  This step aligns with bwa and 
                        returns a single bam file containing all reads mapped or otherwise and a QC metrics file.
                        Used in ENCODE to align technical replicates.
- dnase-filter-pe     - Takes one or more paired-end bams produced by '`dnase-align-bwe-pe`' and merges then filters to 
                        include only high quality mapped reads.  This step produces a filtered bam and a QC metrics file.
                        Used in ENCODE to merge technical replicates into a single biological replicate filtered bam file.
- dnase-filter-se     - Takes one or more bams produced by '`dnase-align-bwe-se`' (or '`dnase-align-bwe-pe`') 
                        and merges then filters to include only high quality mapped reads.  This step produces a 
                        filtered bam and a QC metrics file.
                        Used in ENCODE to merge technical replicates into a single biological replicate filtered bam file.
- dnase-eval-bam      - Takes one paired-end bam produced by '`dnase-filter-pe`' or '`dnase-filter-se`', excludes mappings 
                        to chrM, sub-samples reads and generates evaluation data. This step produces a sample bam and a 
                        QC metrics file.
                        Used in ENCODE for QC metrics only.  The subsampled bam file is not saved.
- dnase-call-hotspots - Takes a filtered bam produced by '`dnase-filter-pe`' or '`dnase-filter-se`' and runs hotspots.
                        This step produces narrowPeaks (hotspots) and broadPeaks (regions) in both bed and bigBed format.  
                        The step also produces signals in bigWig format and a hotspot QC metrics file.  
                        Used in ENCODE to produce the target results of DNase experiments.
- dnase-rep-corr      - Takes two density (*.bw) files produced by two runs of '`dnase-call-hotspots`' on separate replicates
                        of the same experiment.  This step produces a single QC metrics file.
                        Used in ENCODE to ensure the reproducibility of results with seperate biological replicates.
